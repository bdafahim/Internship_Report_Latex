The internship is the process of on-the-job training, which is particularly beneficial for students with majors in technical courses.
Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT) provides that glorious opportunity to their students of having an internship within their bachelor program.
IICT always emphasizes industry orientation in academic study. For this purpose industry, people are invited to IICT to talk about their companies and experiences, often some technical courses are entirely conducted by them. The six months internship program is another, possibly most effective, way of achieving industry orientation.
Internship helps the students to link-up their academic experience with industry practices. I have tried my best to combine both. I hope I’m successful, the future semesters of my degree will prove the fact of success and failure.
The company I was sent for an internship is Orbitax Limited. It is one of the leading software companies in Bangladesh.

There are some limitations in this report. All the contents cannot be shared outside the office. I
only  describe in this report what
I learnt from this company and what feedbacks I got from my team members and co-workers, so
all the data given in this report may not be perfect.
Moreover, gathering data and review the report from office employees was also a tough job. It was quite hard to get time from them in the busy business hours during this pandemic.
