\subsection{DAC6 Reporter}\
\textbf{DAC6 imposes mandatory reporting of cross-border arrangements affecting at least one EU Member State that fall within one of a number of “hallmarks”.}\\
All MNEs with business operations in the EU must comply with DAC6. This applies irrespective of where the MNE is headquartered (US HQ MNE which have entities in any of the EU countries will need to comply). Also, there are no minimum thresholds before DAC6 reporting applies and no safe harbor exceptions.\\
Similarly, any intermediary (e.g. tax advisory firm) that is registered to do business in the EU will need to comply with DAC6 reporting requirements.\\
DAC6 is not just about aggressive tax planning. The Directive has been drafted as such that it also applies to standard transactions with no particular tax motive. This means that ordinary transactions such as cross-border leasing, intercompany royalty payments, securitization structures, certain types of reinsurance and many standard group corporate funding structures may be reportable. \\
Severe penalties could apply to failure to comply with DAC6. The Netherlands for example has proposed penalties as much as EUR 830,000

The object of obsession changes over time sometimes is just a new programming trick, or sometimes it’s a game that we are playing. People outside of Orbitax point these out as signs of our insanity. But Orbitax proud of them
